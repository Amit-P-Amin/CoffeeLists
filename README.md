### Description

This app allows the user to view and edit nested lists of content.

You can see it live here: [here](https://evercoffeelist.herokuapp.com/).

#### Features

- the user can view fully nested items
- items maintain an order defined in the data model (add a position column)
- the user can collapse the nested item views (like closing a folder in a file explorer)
- the user can edit the title and content values of each item and save the state to the database
- the user can drag and drop to reorder the items within a list
- the user can drag and drop to nest an item under a different list

#### Future Plans
- Allow addition of an item
- Use SQL or ActiveRecord to get necessary values, not enumerable methods
